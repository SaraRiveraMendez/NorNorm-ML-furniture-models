    Log model assets at the end of each epoch during training.

    This function is called at the end of each training epoch to log metrics, learning rates, and model information
    to a Comet ML experiment. It also logs model assets, confusion matrices, and image predictions based on
    configuration settings.

    The function retrieves the current Comet ML experiment and logs various training metrics. If it's the first epoch,
    it also logs model information. On specified save intervals, it logs the model, confusion matrix (if enabled),
    and image predictions (if enabled).

    Args:
        trainer (BaseTrainer): The YOLO trainer object containing training state, metrics, and configuration.

    Examples:
        >>> # Inside a training loop
        >>> on_fit_epoch_end(trainer)  # Log metrics and assets to Comet ML
