class VisionEye(BaseSolution):
    """
    A class to manage object detection and vision mapping in images or video streams.

    This class extends the BaseSolution class and provides functionality for detecting objects,
    mapping vision points, and annotating results with bounding boxes and labels.

    Attributes:
        vision_point (Tuple[int, int]): Coordinates (x, y) where vision will view objects and draw tracks.

    Methods:
        process: Process the input image to detect objects, annotate them, and apply vision mapping.

    Examples:
        >>> vision_eye = VisionEye()
        >>> frame = cv2.imread("frame.jpg")
        >>> results = vision_eye.process(frame)
        >>> print(f"Total detected instances: {results.total_tracks}")

        Initialize the VisionEye class for detecting objects and applying vision mapping.

        Args:
            **kwargs (Any): Keyword arguments passed to the parent class and for configuring vision_point.
