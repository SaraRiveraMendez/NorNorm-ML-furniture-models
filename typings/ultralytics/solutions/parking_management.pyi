class ParkingPtsSelection:
    """
    A class for selecting and managing parking zone points on images using a Tkinter-based UI.

    This class provides functionality to upload an image, select points to define parking zones, and save the
    selected points to a JSON file. It uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

    Attributes:
        tk (module): The Tkinter module for GUI operations.
        filedialog (module): Tkinter's filedialog module for file selection operations.
        messagebox (module): Tkinter's messagebox module for displaying message boxes.
        master (tk.Tk): The main Tkinter window.
        canvas (tk.Canvas): The canvas widget for displaying the image and drawing bounding boxes.
        image (PIL.Image.Image): The uploaded image.
        canvas_image (ImageTk.PhotoImage): The image displayed on the canvas.
        rg_data (List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]): List of bounding boxes, each defined by 4 points.
        current_box (List[Tuple[int, int]]): Temporary storage for the points of the current bounding box.
        imgw (int): Original width of the uploaded image.
        imgh (int): Original height of the uploaded image.
        canvas_max_width (int): Maximum width of the canvas.
        canvas_max_height (int): Maximum height of the canvas.

    Methods:
        initialize_properties: Initialize properties for image, canvas, bounding boxes, and dimensions.
        upload_image: Upload and display an image on the canvas, resizing it to fit within specified dimensions.
        on_canvas_click: Handle mouse clicks to add points for bounding boxes on the canvas.
        draw_box: Draw a bounding box on the canvas using the provided coordinates.
        remove_last_bounding_box: Remove the last bounding box from the list and redraw the canvas.
        redraw_canvas: Redraw the canvas with the image and all bounding boxes.
        save_to_json: Save the selected parking zone points to a JSON file with scaled coordinates.

    Examples:
        >>> parking_selector = ParkingPtsSelection()
        >>> # Use the GUI to upload an image, select parking zones, and save the data

class ParkingManagement(BaseSolution):
    """
    Manages parking occupancy and availability using YOLO model for real-time monitoring and visualization.

    This class extends BaseSolution to provide functionality for parking lot management, including detection of
    occupied spaces, visualization of parking regions, and display of occupancy statistics.

    Attributes:
        json_file (str): Path to the JSON file containing parking region details.
        json (List[Dict]): Loaded JSON data containing parking region information.
        pr_info (Dict[str, int]): Dictionary storing parking information (Occupancy and Available spaces).
        arc (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for available region visualization.
        occ (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for occupied region visualization.
        dc (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for centroid visualization of detected objects.

    Methods:
        process: Process the input image for parking lot management and visualization.

    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.solutions import ParkingManagement
        >>> parking_manager = ParkingManagement(model="yolo11n.pt", json_file="parking_regions.json")

        Process the input image for parking lot management and visualization.

        This function analyzes the input image, extracts tracks, and determines the occupancy status of parking
        regions defined in the JSON file. It annotates the image with occupied and available parking spots,
        and updates the parking information.

        Args:
            im0 (np.ndarray): The input inference image.

        Returns:
            (SolutionResults): Contains processed image `plot_im`, 'filled_slots' (number of occupied parking slots),
                'available_slots' (number of available parking slots), and 'total_tracks' (total number of tracked objects).

        Examples:
